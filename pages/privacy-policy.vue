            <p>
              Feirm is a privacy focused project. We enjoy making applications
              that allow users to transact freely and without any limitations.
              In order to protect our users, it is imperative that our
              applications are as secure and private as possible.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Feirm Platform, for example, is completely private by design.
              We do not go out of our way to collect any more data than
              necessary for users to use our platform/services.
            </p>

            <h1 class="title">Data collection</h1>
            <p>
              Feirm itself does not collect any analytics or metrics about how
              services are being utilised. However, as some Feirm services are
              accessed via the web browser, our deploys are automatically
              handled with Netlify and distributed across their global CDN.
              Please refer to
              <a href="https://www.netlify.com/privacy/)"
                >Netlify's Privacy Policy</a
              >
              for more information.
            </p>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Data we do not collect</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Our website and other platforms never try to link your usage to
                your personal identity. The Feirm platform only requires a
                username, strong password and six-digit PIN to sign up.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="subtitle">Information that we share</h2>
            <p>
              To put it quite simply, we do not share or sell any data with
              third parties. We are not in the business of gathering as much
              information as possible about our users.
            </p>

              If you would like to found out more information or have any
              suggestions about how we can further protect your privacy, please
