                  In 2020, there were 5 major hacks which took place on
                  cryptocurrency platforms/exchanges. The total value of these
                  hacks summed up to <strong>$286,933,760</strong>.

                <p>
                  Alongside the initial theft of funds,
                  <strong>200 pieces</strong> of personally-identifiable
                  information were breached.

                  Feirm does not want to know anything about our users. We only

                  Feirm does not rely on mobile application stores for

                  the application directly from your browser.
